# 2nd Data Visualization Challenge

This repository contains my contribution for the [Allianz data visualization challenge](https://www.meetup.com/Data-Visualization-Meetup-Munich/messages/boards/thread/50854350) hosted by the [Data Visualization Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Data-Visualization-Meetup-Munich/) in Munich.

The task was to visualize a fictive data set to give insights about the books genres of books which the customers have bought.

## Solution

Instead of presenting a static visualization I wanted to tell a Story with the help of an interactive D3 Chord Diagram. My solution was build on top of [Nadieh Bremer's](https://www.visualcinnamon.com/2014/12/using-data-storytelling-with-chord.html) great tutorial. I adjusted the code to the challange and added several cool features.

And this is the final result.
